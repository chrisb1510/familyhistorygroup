Transcribed Home page paragraphs. 
hometemplate.ect with take data from content/homeTemplate.coffee
Paragraphs are now displayed with sectioning and separate articles.
Needs work on Grammar and sectioning.

membershipTemplate.ect shows relevant sections, needs a little more work, want to implement a form so postal applications shouldnt be necessary(except payment)

mainNavigation.coffee takes data from content/navlinks.coffee and displays list of links, currently not implemented as true links.

About section started, file tree may need to change, although Im hoping to implement a mongodb backend 
Grants section is transcribed.
Membership Page is Transcribed.
Lots of repetition and poor grammar again.

Footer shows logos and links to groups which support bfhg.
