        p1:'Burntwood Family History Group was founded in 1986 in the living room of a house in Burntwood by a small group of people with the idea of researching their family history.We have steadily grown and our membership exceeds one hundred. Our aim continues to bring together those who are interested in the research of their family history and although we are a small group, our postal membership is worldwide.
            Our Group functions entirely by the efforts of voluntary workers and is non-profit making. 
            We produce a quarterly journal which is available free to Members and at a small cost to non members, and whether you are a seasoned genealogist or new to researching your family history, we are sure you will find something of interest to you, and we will help you get started.
            We have two monthly meetings both held at the Burntwood Old Mining College
            The first is when we have a guest speaker to give a talk on a family history connected 
            subject to increase our knowledge and help in our research. 
            The second when we meet for an informal discussion and research our family history through the use of our library 
            stock of microfiche, CDs, DVDs, books, videos and the internet. 
            Both meetings are open to Members and non members alike. 
            We also organise Group vists. 
            All meeting dates can be found in our diary.'
