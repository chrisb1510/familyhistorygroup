                                It hardly seems possible that we, members of the Burntwood Family History Group are approaching 
                                our second birthday! Since the evening two years ago when my living room was overflowing with people 
                                who had responded to an article in the Lichfield Mercury asking for potential members for a new 
                                Family History Group our membership has increased steadily and our expertise too. What an assorted lot 
                                we were (and still are!) ranging from teenagers to senior citizens, and from beginners to fairly expert. 
                                However, there are two things we all have in common, the interest in Family History, and the friendly 
                                nature that allows us to get on so well. 
                                We have enjoyed the company of many interesting speakers during the last two years and 
                                increased our own knowledge of several aspects of local and family history through them. 
                                We have also increased our ability to decipher old handwriting, thanks to Chris Latimer of the Walsall 
                                Local Studies History Centre. 
                                Since our inauguration we have undertaken a number of research linked visits and hope to continue to 
                                do so in the future. At present we are organising a coach trip to St. Catherine\'s House and London 
                                repositories on Friday June 17th. Families and friends are welcome to accompany us, is make sure you 
                                have booked your seats, the price has been held at £5, and we will leave the Burntwood area at about 
                                7a.m. and return from London at 6.30p.m. to arrive back at approx. 9.30p.m. 
                                Other trips in the pipeline (depending upon your wishes) are to the Society of Genealogists, 
                                a working evening at the Mormon Library, Sutton Coldfield and a visit to the Public Record 
                                Office at Kew. 
                                It is proposed to produce a newsletter at fairly regular intervals and we hope to keep our local, 
                                and out-of-area members in touch with what is going on. If you have any contributions, large or small, 
                                please get them to me and I will endeavour to include them in the next publication. Helpful hints, 
                                unusual sources, amusing incidents - all are welcome. 
                                Finally, thanks must be extended to all Committee Members for their hard work keeping the Group running 
                                so well. Grateful thanks also to Wendy Fawcett who has taken over management of the Library and resources and is doing a grand job. Last, but not least, thanks to you, the members for your interest and support. Good Hunting!

                                The Mormon Church Library at Lichfield has been open for some months now and Family Historians who go 
                                there are made to feel very welcome. Not only do they have the I.G.I. and other usual records there, 
                                but they are instigating a new idea. If you order a census, they obtain it from America, and if you 
                                agree to pay a small amount extra, (usually about 25p) that census is retained at Lichfield permanently,
                                so that you can go back and look at it as often as you like. This seemed a very good idea to us, 
                                and we have started to promote the scheme!

                                Since the publication of our last News Sheet, the Burntwood Family History Group have spent a very 
                                busy and eventful Summer and early Autumn. Apart from the usual meetings with their variety of speakers,
                                we have organised working evenings at the Sutton Mormon Library, an exhibition at the local library at 
                                Sankeys Corner, a trip to the Society of Genealogists, an information table at the Walsall Local History
                                Fair and are about to play our part in the national drive to index the 1881 Census. Still in the 
                                pipeline is our Christmas Celebration meal and another visit to St. Catherine\'s House. Believe it or 
                                not, all of this will have taken place between June and December this year!
                                Particular thanks should go to Wendy Fawcett for her great assistance in organising the display at the 
                                Library, and Chris Frankland for her help at the Local History Fair. 
                                Last month we acquired (at long last) the eagerly awaited 1988 version of the I.G.I. I am told that 
                                bookings for the hire of the Microfiche reader and the I.G.I. are well under way and there are no 
                                vacant weeks until 1989, so if you are interested in using it at your leisure, make sure you make 
                                your booking with Trevor Fawcett soon. Remember, it\'s great value at only 50p a week for the complete 
                                loan. 
                                On the subject of the I.G.I., our thanks again to Wendy Fawcett who has set up a filing system so that 
                                the various counties are all separated and arranged alphabetically in small groups. A marker card is 
                                provided so that the fiches can be replaced in Exactly the right place, something that is very important
                                to avoid frustration. 
                                We are awaiting with interest news of our first social venture, the Christmas meal. 
                                This is being organised by June Taylor and Lynn Bates for December 6th. At the time of writing no 
                                details of this are known, but even so several members are looking forward to the event!
                                Our last meeting was combined with the A.G.M. (Annual General Meeting) and members were encouraged to 
                                elect a committee of their choice. In fact the only change that took place, was the election of Jane 
                                Leake to the position of Vice-Chairperson, a position which had not previously existed but was becoming 
                                necessary due to the growth in membership. 
                                Finally, my thanks to the people who have contributed material to be printed in the News Letter. 
                                Every little helps, so if anyone has anything they would like to contribute to the next publication, 
                                it would be most welcome. In particular, a brief account of your experiences whilst researching, 
                                good or bad, would make interesting reading for the rest of us. So would any problems you are
                                encountering, as copies of the News Letter go far and wide and you might receive help from an unexpected
                                source. 
                                Good hunting!

                                Jane Leake 
                                On Saturday 8th October a group of members and their friends set off to visit the Society of Genealogists
                                in London. For most of us it was a first visit eagerly anticipated. After a few minor hiccups and 
                                dropping off the shoppers, we arrived at Charterhouse Buildings. 
                                A very pleasant and knowledgeable young man conducted us round the various floors and tried to explain 
                                the mountain of information gathered there. It was difficult to take it all in at once but most of us 
                                had spotted things that looked interesting or of use to our research and were keen to be let loose. 
                                After paying the necessary fee and fortifying ourselves with lunch and coffee in the members lounge we 
                                went our separate ways. Some were drawn to the microfiche readers to look at the I.G.I. or to view films 
                                of parish registers. Others ploughed through the Great Card Index or the many collections of private one 
                                name studies. I had no idea so many indexes existed, let alone under one roof: The collection of county 
                                directories and histories proved useful to several people and the time went very quickly. Most of us 
                                visited the bookshop and came away with yet more charts and books to add to our collections. Several 
                                people had a successful afternoon and found information to aid their own research but we all increased 
                                our knowledge of genealogical resources. Those of us who read Family Tree Magazine will now be able to 
                                follow A.J. Camp\'s articles with added interest having been there and I am sure many of us will want 
                                to return when the opportunity arises. 
                                REMINDERS  
                                If you are looking for Family History books in the public library, the number to look for is 929. 

                                Don\'t forget there is an informal discussion after the speaker at each of the meetings. 
                                We are looking for another microfiche reader for the group so if anyone knows where we might be able 
                                to find one please let us know. 
                                If anyone has any contributions for the next News Letter could they please let me, Christine Elson, 
                                have them by the February meeting or by phoning Lichfield 264127, any contribution large or small will be welcome. 
                                Many thanks to all who have contributed to this publication.'

                                Compared to most family historians my research has been quite straight-forward. All of my male forebears 
                                have been Staffordshire men. Two of them did stray slightly and. marry out of the county, one in 
                                Bridgnorth (my great-grandfather) and one in Hamburg (my grandfather), but then proceeded to bring their 
                                wives to Staffordshire to live. 
                                It was not very difficult to trace my origins back to the village of Wombourne, Staffs and to a certain 
                                Thomas and Elizabeth Deans who were mentioned in the Parish register (which began 1570) on 4th April 1630
                                when son Thomas was born, and these two were undoubtedly the predecessors of the dozens of Deans 
                                appearing in the later Wombourne census lists. But where did Thomas and Elizabeth come from? All that has
                                emerged from 4 years of research has been that on 16th April 1622 a Thomas Dearne, Deane or Deans married
                                Elizabeth Cowper in the parish of Codsall never to appear in the Codsall registers again. As the villages
                                of Codsall and Wombourne are not very far apart it would seem reasonable to assume that it was the same
                                couple. 
                                This presumably brings me to My heading of "How much of Staffordshire is Mine". Whilst browsing through
                                \'Historical Collections of Staffordshire\'. Vol X111 page 232 I came upon the following interesting entry - 
                                "Thu Quindene of Easter in the 6th Year of the Reign of Elizabeth 1 (1564) Between Ralph Brooke and 
                                Laurence Eyton, complainants, and Richard Wood, otherwise Deane, deforciant of two messuages, two cottages,
                                a dovecote, four gardens, three hundred acres of land, one hundred acres of meadow, two hundred acres of
                                pasture, one hundred acres of wood, and forty acres of furze and heath in Codsall, parcel of the said 
                                tenements for his life, with the remainder to Walter Wood, otherwise Deane, another of sons of the said 
                                Richard, and his issue male, and failing such to Edward wood, otherwise Deane, another of the sons of the 
                                said Richard and failing such to the right heirs of the said Richard forever. They also granted the 
                                tenements in Moseley and Esyngton the residue of the said tenements, to the said Richard for 18 years, 
                                with remainder after that term is ended, to the said ,Walter and his issue male, and failing such, to the 
                                said Edward and his issue male, and failing such to the right heirs of the said Richard forever.
                                As this legal action related to land and property in the Codsall area in 1564 one of the Deans mentioned 
                                could well be the father or grandfather of Thomas Deans. If I could find the one or two missing links 
                                would I be able to claim all this land as mine? Somehow I don\'t think so.

                                Once again I find myself writing a brief review of the last months activities involving the Burntwood 
                                Family History Group. 
                                Some of us met at the beginning of December for a festive meal at the Redmore Inn. This was our first 
                                real social venture and we liked it so much that plans are even now afoot for a celebration for next 
                                Christmas. We have broadened our horizons and are planning a quite ambitious venture - a medieval banquet!
                                If anyone is interested in joining us and has not put their name on the list, would they please see June 
                                Taylor or Lynn Bates as soon as possible for details. 
                                The Christmas holiday saw as heading off for our now usual trip to London. Again we discovered that the 
                                period directly after Christmas was an ideal time, because the usual crowds were not in evidence at 
                                St. Catherine\'s House. There was, however, quite a queue at the Census Office in Portugal Street and 
                                again I noticed a certain lack of civility from some of the staff behind the counter. It seemed a shame 
                                that a most enjoyable day should have had that one black spot. Apart from that, as usual, we all came 
                                home with plenty to talk about and most people had a fair amount of success with their research. 
                                Our next trip to London is being organised for Thursday 1st June, book your seat early if you can. 
                                Remember, any friends or relatives who would like to join as for a shopping expedition are most welcome 
                                to do so. Our group project to help with the national indexing of the 1881 Census is getting under way. 
                                Several people have offered to take part and their personal handbooks and guides have been distributed. 
                                As soon as I receive the printed copies of the Census from Richard Sowter in Bristol, we can begin our 
                                working evenings at the Methodist Church. These will take place on the Tuesday that falls a fortnight 
                                after our normal meetings, so that we shall be meeting twice monthly from then on. 
                                Finally, the Walsall Local History Centre has informed on that the annual Local History Day will be held 
                                on Saturday 20th May 1989. Again, anyone who would like t, take part, manning our Group table would be 
                                very welcome, even if only for an hour or two while you do your shopping. Last year it was good. 
                                This year it promises to as better. My thanks to all Members who are working as hard to make our Group 
                                a success. We seem to be going from strength to strength. 
                                Remember, if you have something interesting you would like included in the Newsletter, write it down and 
                                hand it to Christine Elson who so nobly edits for us. 
                                Good luck with your research.

                                Jane Leake 
                                When discussing family history one day with my mother-in-law I was most surprised to learn that neither 
                                she nor my father-in-law had any idea where their fathers were buried. Both had joined the Notts Derbys 
                                Regiment (Sherwood Foresters) in 1914 and lost their lives in 1915/16. Mother\'s father, Alfred Hine, on
                                the Somme and father\'s father, Samuel Leake, at Gallipoli. 
                                I decided to dig deeper and wrote to that most helpful organisation, the Commonwealth War Graves 
                                Commission. After quite a short time their reply arrived saying they had both died at the Battle of the 
                                Somme. Samuel Leake unfortunately has no known grave but is commemorated on the enormous Thiepral 
                                Memorial between Albert and Bapaume. Thomas Hine however was buried in the village of Serques, quite near
                                to St. Omer, and eventually they sent a photograph of the headstone for just a small fee. 
                                My mother-in-law was quite overcome but was excited to see it, as was her brother, who was named after the 
                                father he never saw. 
                                On our way home from holiday in the Dordogne area of France last year we were able to visit the village 
                                and find the grave. Imagine our surprise to find his was the only war grave there! It was carefully 
                                tended having a crucifix and two vases of plastic flowers resting on it. We were interested to find out 
                                how he died but it was lunchtime so of course there were no French people around to ask. 
                                On returning home I was determined to make an effort to find out how he died. I wrote a letter to the 
                                Mayor of Serques, which Pam kindly translated into French for me, and awaited a reply. It took some weeks
                                but eventually a letter from France dropped through the letterbox. The Mayor said he had talked to the old
                                people of the village and found that Thomas Hine, with a small group of hungry soldiers had gone fishing in 
                                the River Somme. They had used hand grenades and somehow Thomas had been killed when one of them exploded 
                                close to him. It was 25th December 1915. A few weeks ago there was a picture in the Independent of an Afghan 
                                \'rebel\' fishing in a river using a rocket grenade launcher: It is obviously a technique still used by soldiers
                                but I hope he had better luck than Thomas Hine!

                                A CRY FOR HELP 
                                Pam Woodburn 
                                As most of you already know I do an evening class in Family History in Stafford Prison, and I would be 
                                very grateful if any members would consider having their birth/marriage/death certificates for one of 
                                their lines photocopied (at my expense) so that I might use them for a \'Build the Family Tree\' exercise
                                that I do with the prisoners. They find it very challenging and frustrating and is the nearest thing they
                                will get to researching for themselves. It also provides very good practice! If you can help, please let
                                me know. '

                        'text':'ST. CATHERINE\'S HOUSE - DEC. 1988
                                Tony Wallington 
                                At 6.15am on the 4th day of Christmas my true love woke me with "If you are going to St. Catherine\'s 
                                House you had better get up." An hour later, it was still dark when we boarded the coach in Queen Street 
                                while being serenaded by some early songbird in a tree behind Cottage Lane. 
                                Like many others I had formulated my Priorities in advance. Having experienced the poor light at 
                                Somerset House this time of year and no immediate need to see any census records, I decided to remain at
                                St. Catherine\'s House all day. My priorities were (after locating the toilet) :- 
                                1) To order a copy of a great grandmother\'s marriage certificate to assist locating her home in Ireland,
                                and her father\'s first name. 
                                2) To order a copy of either a grandmother\'s birth certificate or her parents marriage certificate and 
                                so start on another great grandmother\'s line. 
                                3) To trace the movements of one set of teacher great grandparents, who moved every 2 - 3 years, by 
                                tracing the birth registration districts of their children. 
                                4) To record approximately the dates and age at death of my father\'s 7 brothers and sisters who died in
                                infancy. 
                                5) To record more birth, marriage and death data on anyone bearing the family name so that this data can 
                                be incorporated into a Database of a \'One Name Study\'
                                I quickly completed the work on 1, 2 and 3 and I did a substantial amount on number 5 before going on to 
                                number 4 and ran out of time. 
                                I collected a considerable amount of data which will need analysing in the coming weeks. I am finding 
                                considerable correlation between parishes shown in the I.G.I. as containing families bearing my surname,
                                and the areas in which the same name occurs in birth, marriage and death registrations 200 years later. 
                                It was reassuring to see that in those areas which showed no I.G.I. entries to date, showed no 
                                registration records so far. This fact will save me searching those parishes not yet in the I.G.I for 
                                non-existent records. 
                                It was, for me, a very successful visit. 

                                ANOTHER CRY FOR HELP 
                                I have received a letter from. Mr. Anthony Stevens who asks if anyone in the group can help him. He is 
                                researching the name FAUX, FORKS, FORKES, FOWKES. in the Burton-on-Trent area. He has traced his ancestor
                                WILLIAM FAUX on the Burton transcripts, baptised 13/11/1812. He offers reciprocal research in the 
                                Manchester area if anyone is interested. I will be glad to pass on his letter to anyone who might be able
                                to offer help.

                        'text':'IN THE RECORDS  
                                When we look at documents in Record Offices we often come across intriguing entries by looking up 
                                references in indexes and one also comes across the odd examples of a Parish Register being used for 
                                Parish notes. 
                                In the baptism book of Pitton Farley, Wilts, between 1711 and 1713 entries in a parish which had 1 or 2 
                                baptisms a year is the entry in 1712:- 
                                \'Chapel yard Farley\' measuring 7 3/4X 25 lug breadth Northend 41/2 lug middle 21/2 lug southend 
                                (A lug is the same as the old rod, pole or pearch it 5 1/2 yards) 
                                Another reference to Pitton Farley, this time an insolvency case:- 
                                Jeremiah Bryant, a carpenter of Pitton Farley near Salisbury, died intestate in 1820 leaving a widow and
                                5 children all under 21. His estate was valued at £200-15-8 net. The widow took out letters of 
                                administration. Under the Statute of Distribution the widow would have been entitled to 1/3, and the 
                                children share 2/3 of the £200. The widow signed a declaration that she would retain in trust for her 
                                children their share. On her own authority and in her own name the widow carried on her deceased husbands
                                business using the property and effects which she had taken over administration. 
                                The widow clothed, fed and brought up the children employing them in the business as journeymen without 
                                wages until they were 21. 
                                After 10 years Mrs. Bryant\'s business was in financial difficulties. With creditors wanting their money
                                the widow claimed that she was entitled to the original 1/3 of her husband\'s estate i.e £66 while the 
                                children claimed that they had not had their 2/3 of their father\'s estate. 
                                The court ruled that the business creditors should be paid, the widow had abused her administration and 
                                the children had had the value of their inheritance during their upbringing. 
                                The property and effects were sold for £103 while the debts totalled £300, a shortfall of £193. 
                                The property was advertised as being in three good lives aged 59, 21 and 26 years. 
                                Another entry noted was that someone given permission to attend and touch the king for the \'kings evil\'. 
                                WORTH REMEMBERING 
                                The archive section at Birmingham Central Library now closes all day on a Wednesday. 
                                The St. Catherine\'s Indexes at Birmingham Central Library now begin with 1837 instead of 1865 as previously. 
                                There is also now a charge of £1 per hour and has to be booked in advance.'
